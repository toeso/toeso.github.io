<span class="dropcap">W</span>e went to Venezuela three times in the last six months, spending a total of about two months in this beautiful country. When talking to people about our experiences, common questions like how complicated is it to go there; is it really that cheap; is the situation really as shown in the news or social media; came up repeatedly. Therefore, we decided to write up the most common questions and our answers. First of all, one thing: 

> Venezuela is a terrific place and well worth visiting.

Even though the country and its society are living through difficult times, it continues to be full of magic places, noble people, rhythms and tastes that charm anyone. If you consider visiting Venezuela, here goes our list of recommendations.

# Money

Because of the hyperinflation, that is affecting the country, the Bolivar Fuerte is anything but strong. Actually, it is almost worthless even when compared to neighboring currencies such as the Colombian peso or the Brazilian real. This turns out to be advantageous for tourists who can enjoy more by paying less. The cost per night in a decent hotel, for example, should not exceed 10 USD. Even so, the following should be kept in mind:

-	The only accepted currency is Bolivares, even when paying by card, you can only use national cards

-	Cash is quite complicated to get to; these days people pay most things by bank transfer or debit/credit cards.

-	Because of the currency control in place, changing money at official rates is next to insane. It sounds strange but we recommend you do not use exchange offices: you will get a much better rate at the parallel market.

Because of the above, we recommend you talk to some friend or known person in Venezuela who can let you use their debit card and bank account for the time of your stay. No one checks documents when you are paying anyways so you should have no problems by taking that route.

To change your money to Bolivares we do recommend two options. The first one is bringing USD in cash and selling them on the parallel market. You can get the latest price at dolartoday.com and it will be very easy to find a buyer who will transfer the amount of Bolivares to a bank account of your choice.

The second option, the one we prefer, is to buy Bitcoins before travelling and then use them to buy Bolivares on localbitcoins.com. We find this is the fastest and most secure way, as you will not have to carry cash when travelling. If you are new to the world of bitcoin and would like a more detailed explanation, check out our next post: How to buy Bolivares with Bitcoins.

We do hope you found this first post about Venezuela useful and will continue to share our experiences and recommendations. Please feel free to leave a comment and we will gladly try to help you out as best as we can.

See you!
