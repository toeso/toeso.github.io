> {% include insta hashtag="Oidy" %} is a project based on a concept of artwork as a vehicle of energy that I, the creator assigned to it.
What I want most for myself, others and the world is a feeling of comfort, safety and closeness. Therefore, I create psychically practical things. Talismans for the times when so many want us to be scared, I say "It will be alright! I'll keep an eye on you!" **~ Paulina Szołoch**

We first met Paulina on a trip to Amsterdam in the fall of 2014. It was our first trip together and while exploring Amsterdam, for some reason we walked into the tattoo studio where she was working at the time. We talked for a short while but haven't been ready to mark our bodies just yet. She gave us her card and we followed her on social media ever since. Little did we know that we would later get a talisman from her, that makes Paulina a special part of our story. 

# Fast forward to 2018

A lot has happened, Paulina has moved back to her hometown in Poland, opened her own studio, and started the _Oidy_ tattoo project. We lived in Colombia for a while, traveled a lot, and have recently moved to some remote place in Germany. Through social media we found out that Paulina would come to Berlin in March and suddenly we had a plan for the weekend. We drove to Berlin and, after a good night's sleep, went to meet Paulina in the {% include insta profile="1928TattooClub" %}.

She creates all her designs either by herself or with her clients and only does a design once. Each _Oid_ is a unique piece of art and a talisman assigned to the lucky bearer. When we arrived at the studio, we sat down together, chatted for a while, and selected some designs we liked. We had the closer selection printed out and tried to position them on our bodies. After some changing and moving around, we found our _Oid_. Or maybe our _Oid_ found us. 

And then, the artist got to work...

While she was at work, we asked Paulina some questions:

What inspired you to start with this project?

> I cannot pinpoint one thing or moment in particular. It comes from observing clients and myself. People come to get a tattoo at an important time in their life. Either when something changed or they would like something to change. People do believe the tattoo will change something in their life. Also, traditionally tattoos always had a spiritual or magical meaning.  

Where does the name _Oidy_ come from?

> It comes from many different things, the first inspiration was the word **odds**, like in the expression "May the odds be with you." Also from the suffix **-oid** like in planetoid, asteroid, or android. Describing something that has properties of one thing but is another. You can see in it whatever you want to see in it.

A fun fact:
Paulina tattooed her dad. Three times.

After some hours of work for her and a little bit of pain for us, we are absolutely in love with the results:

We were really impressed by Paulina's professionalism and getting a tattoo from her was an amazing experience. Paulina clearly loves what she does, she is a real artist and we could feel the positive vibes she put into our tattoos from the very beginning.
