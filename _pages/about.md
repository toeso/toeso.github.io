<span class="dropcap">T</span>O’ ESO – short for “todo eso” and roughly translated from Spanish as “everything” or “all of that” – began as an independent project to share photos and experiences through social media and a blog. After taking some time off to enjoy common pleasures, we soon realized, that we missed a lot because of not making the time and that, by paying attention to the small things, we learned much more in a day of life than at the office. Inspired and quite curious, we quit our conventional jobs and started out on an adventure that keeps us motivated and learning on a daily basis.
