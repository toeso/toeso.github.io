<span class="dropcap">T</span>O’ ESO – short for “todo eso” and roughly translated from Spanish as “all of that” – began as an independent project to share photos and stories through social media and a blog. After taking some time off to enjoy common pleasures, we soon realized that we were missing a lot because of not having time. We started paying attention to little, seemingly unimportant things and soon were learning a lot more in a day of life than at the office.

Inspired and quite curious, we quit our conventional jobs and started out on an adventure that keeps us motivated and learning on a daily basis.
